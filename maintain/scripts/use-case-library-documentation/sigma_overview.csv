Review the process creation logs from the Windows Event Log or a SIEM solution. 
Look for instances of wuauclt.exe process creation events. 
Check the command line associated with each wuauclt.exe process. 
If the command line does not contain any command line flags, it may indicate suspicious activity. 
Compare the process creation events with known legitimate Windows Update Agent activity to identify anomalies.
